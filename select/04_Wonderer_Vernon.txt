Wonderer Wondering, wonder, wonderer
You're searching for what, what is to search
You're longing and looking once again for a home
Angery, anger and agony
The pain is pain, pain is to be
The remedy is on its way it will relieve

Been through the fire and been through the rain
Called the wonderer yet have no name
If I were you won't you want me or is in my head.
Or is it in my head
Or is it in my head

Property Pride prosperity
Nothing to lose lost everything
I'm needing peace of mind and wanting to be free

Doubtful doubt and doubting
See all I know I know what I see
The time has come for you, this time it's right for me

Been through the fire and been through the rain
Called the wonderer yet have no name
If I were you won't you want me or is in my head.
Or is it in my head
Or is it in my head
