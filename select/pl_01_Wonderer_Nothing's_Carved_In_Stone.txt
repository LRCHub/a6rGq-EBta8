Everybody wants to know the secret
People try and try to make it meaningful
Time after time, another story
You've heard it all, it could be boring
A boy and girl, a special journey
The scent of spring, her hair was flowing
(And yet again)
The summer sun delivers damage
Unending need, a test of patience
A falling out, it can't be salvaged
And with the snow, it ends in silence
Maybe it all was meant to be
After all, what's happened can't be undone
Pain is the pleasure to start anew
Only those who take the leap of faith will know
You'll know
Tomorrow comes without a stop your time will
come to be in front
Although right now the sorrow seems like it'll
never disappear
Tomorrow comes without a stop your time will
come to be in front
Although right now the sorrow seems like it'll
never disappear
Tomorrow comes wow oh oh
The sorrow's gone wow oh oh
Tomorrow comes wow oh oh
The sorrow's gone wow oh oh
Everybody wants to know the secret
People try and try to make a meaning
You wonder, slowly ponder
searching through the binary
Keep scrolling on
Keep scrolling on
You try and try to understand it all
Tomorrow comes without a stop your time will
come to be in front
Although right now the sorrow seems like it'll
never disappear
Tomorrow comes without a stop your time will
come to be in front
Although right now the sorrow seems like it'll
never disappear
Tomorrow comes wow oh oh
The sorrow's gone wow oh oh
Tomorrow comes wow oh oh
The sorrow's gone wow oh oh
